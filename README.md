# Work CLI

Who needs interns when we have clankers to do our bidding?

Simple CLI time tracker for freelancers. Track work sessions across multiple clients with automatic billing calculations, PDF invoice generation, and AI-powered work summaries.

**Dependencies:** Requires [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) for `summarize` and `descriptions populate` commands that analyze local git repositories to generate work summaries per-client. Requires your own [Turso](https://turso.tech/) sqlite database if you want to share sessions between machines.

## Installation

### Local Use Only (Single Machine)
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd work

# If you want to be able to share sessions between machines, sign up to Turso and configure .env.mine with your database URL & turso token
# In this case, make sure your database name is the same as the BIN_NAME in .env
# After creating your db, run `make prod-turso-setup`

# Install with sqlite on your machine
make install

# Or install with turso, using `make prod-init && make prod-install`. You should only ever need to run `make prod-init` once.
```

## Usage

After installation, create a client using `work create -c clientname -r 100`, to create a client with a $100 hourly rate.

The main use case is starting and stopping work sessions, using `work start -c clientname` and `work stop`. You may then use `work list` to see your logged sessions.

To generate invoices for a period of time, use `work invoices -p fortnight -d 2025-08-23`, which generates an invoice per client for the specified period.

For more information, use `work help` or `work help <command>`. Current output is below.
