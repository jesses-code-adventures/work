# Work CLI

Who needs interns when we have clankers to do our bidding?

Simple CLI time tracker for freelancers. Track work sessions across multiple clients with automatic billing calculations, PDF invoice generation, and AI-powered work summaries.

**Dependencies:** Requires [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) for `summarize` and `descriptions populate` commands that analyze local git repositories to generate work summaries per-client. Requires your own [Turso](https://turso.tech/) sqlite database if you want to share sessions between machines.

## Installation

### Local Use Only (Single Machine)
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd work
make install
```

### Remote Database Usage (If you need to track work across multiple machines)
```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone <repository-url>
cd work

# Download turso, authenticate, create a database with the name $(BIN_NAME) from the .env file
make prod-turso-setup

# Configure .env with your Turso database - you'll need to create a token and get your database URL for these steps
echo "TURSO_TOKEN=your_turso_token_here" >> .env.mine
echo "PROD_DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-database.turso.io" >> .env.mine

# Run initial migrations - should only ever need to do this once
make prod-init

# Build and install
make prod-install
```

## Usage

After installation, create a client using `work create -c clientname -r 100`, to create a client with a $100 hourly rate.

The main use case is starting and stopping work sessions, using `work start -c clientname` and `work stop`. You may then use `work list` to see your logged sessions.

To generate invoices for a period of time, use `work invoices -p fortnight -d 2025-08-23`, which generates an invoice per client for the specified period.

For more information, use `work help` or `work help <command>`. Current output is below.
